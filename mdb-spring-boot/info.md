Structuring a Spring Boot application with MongoDB involves organizing your classes based on the principles of separation of concerns and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. While the traditional MVC layers (presentation, business, persistence, and database) are applicable, the structure might be a bit different when working with MongoDB.

Here's a suggested structure:

1. **Model:**
   - Define your domain model classes. These are the Java classes that represent the entities you will be storing in MongoDB.

   ```java
   @Document(collection = "users")
   public class User {
       @Id
       private String id;
       private String username;
       private String email;

       // Constructors, getters, setters, etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Repository:**
   - Create a repository interface that extends `MongoRepository` to perform CRUD operations on your MongoDB collections.

   ```java
   public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
       // You can define custom query methods here if needed
       User findByUsername(String username);
   }
   ```

3. **Service:**
   - Implement a service layer that contains business logic and interacts with the repository.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class UserService {
       private final UserRepository userRepository;

       @Autowired
       public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
           this.userRepository = userRepository;
       }

       // Service methods that use userRepository for business logic
   }
   ```

4. **Controller:**
   - Create controllers for handling HTTP requests. These controllers interact with the service layer to execute business logic.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/users")
   public class UserController {
       private final UserService userService;

       @Autowired
       public UserController(UserService userService) {
           this.userService = userService;
       }

       // REST endpoints that handle HTTP requests, using userService
   }
   ```

5. **Configuration:**
   - Configure MongoDB properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

   ```properties
   spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>
   ```

   Ensure that you replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`, and `<database>` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials and database name.

This structure follows the separation of concerns and allows for easy scaling and maintenance. Additionally, you can add further layers or components based on your project requirements.

6. **Password Management:**

- API Requests:
    $body = @{
    username = "newuser"
    email = "newuser@example.com"
    password = "password123"
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
